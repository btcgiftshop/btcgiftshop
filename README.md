## INTRODUCTION

How do you gift someone Bitcoin if you don’t know their wallet address? If you’re enthusiastic about digital assets, you may have to ask for their wallet address, which is like opening Christmas presents early. If you’re not that into crypto, giving gift cards and e-cards can lock your receiver into shopping at a particular retailer. This holiday season, let’s give the gift of Bitcoin! Bitcoin gifts can’t be reversed, have value across the world, are better than giving cash, and your gift here is recorded forever on Bitcoin’s blockchain!
